## Instructions
To test the functions, run the following commands:
```bash
gcc -o driver_session1a driver_session1a.c imt2022076_lab1.c
```
```bash
./driver_session1a filename.txt
```
This will print the result in filename.txt. Similar instructions can be followed for the other text programs.

For the binary programs, use filename.bin instead of filename.txt as the output/input file.
