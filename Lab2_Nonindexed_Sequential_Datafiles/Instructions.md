## Instructions
To test the codes, run the following commands after cloning:
```bash
gcc -o contact_driver contact.c pds.c contact_driver.c
```
```bash
./contact_driver
```

This will create and populate a database demo.dat, and will show the status of each of the 8 tests as either success or failure.
